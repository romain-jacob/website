I am a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich in the group of [Prof. Laurent Vanbever](https://nsg.ee.ethz.ch/people/laurent-vanbever/). My current research interests are focused on computer networks, communication protocols, (real-time) scheduling theory, and statistics applied to experimental design.
You can find out more about my research interests and past activities in [my resume](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/romain-jacob/doc_public/blob/main/cv_full.pdf) and [publication page](/publications).

In 2019, I completed my doctoral studies under the supervision of Prof. Lothar Thiele, also at ETH. My dissertation is entitled [Leveraging Synchronous Transmissions for the Design of Real-time Wireless Cyber-Physical Systems](https://github.com/romain-jacob/doctoral-thesis). Before joining ETH, I obtained a Master of Science in Engineering of Complex Systems (2015) and Master for Faculty Training for Higher Education (2013) both from École Normale Supérieure de Cachan (now ENS Paris-Saclay). In 2014, I spent a year in UC Berkeley as visiting scholar under the supervision of Prof. Karl Hedrick.

I am an [Open Science enthusiast](/pledge-to-open-science) and try to advocate for it whenever I can. When time allows, I am also involved in [science communication](/sci-comm) projects.
