# Pledge to Open Science

I am convinced that some practices in science needs to change.

I am not the kind a person that waits for others to do what I consider important.  
Therefore, and inspired by [Erin McKiernan](https://emckiernan.wordpress.com/pledge/), I hereby pledged to watch my own actions and commit to [openness](https://opendefinition.org/).

- I will not edit, review, or work for closed or hybrid access journals or conferences.
- I will publish only in open access journals or conferences; at least when I am the lead author.
- I will post pre-prints, when possible.
- I will promote open review principles.
- I will use open-source software, when possible; if not, I will favor license-free software.
- I will share code and other artifacts, when possible.
- I will share raw and curated data.
- I will promote the [DORA principles](https://sfdora.org/), and in particular...
- I will use [CRediT](https://credit.niso.org/) and publish a contributor's record with all my research outputs.
- I will promote the adoption of [ORCID](https://orcid.org/).
- I will encourage professional societies to support open access.
- I will communicate about my research to the grand public.
- I will limit my professional long-distance flying to one trip per year.
- I will speak out about my choices.
- I will regularly and honestly assess my fulfillment to this pledge.
