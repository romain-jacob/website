    <p>
    In 2016, I participated in an internal "My Thesis in 180s" organized by <a href="http://www.nano-tera.ch/">Nano-Tera.ch</a>, a Swiss initiative that founded multiple cutting-edge research projects, including <a href="http://www.nano-tera.ch/projects/371.php">X-Sense2</a>, in which my group was involved.
    </p><p>
    This performance tells the story of the <a href="https://www.permasense.ch/en.html">PermaSense project</a>, which deploys wireless sensor networks in the mountains to enable fundamental geology and glaciology research... and for early warning!
