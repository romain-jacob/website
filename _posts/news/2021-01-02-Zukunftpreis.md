I am humbled (and very happy!) to announce that our work on "Feedback control goes wireless" has received the [2nd Zukunftspreis](https://ttw.ethz.ch/) (Future Price) from the [Ewald Marquardt foundation](https://www.stiftung-ewaldmarquardt.de/).

In this collaboration with control researchers, we demonstrated provable stability guarantees for multiple inverted pendulums distributed over a multi-hop wireless network. The communication system is based on the [Time-Triggered Wireless Architecture](https://ttw.ethz.ch/) (one of my dissertation work).
