    <p>
    In 2017, I participated in <a href="http://www.famelab.ch/">Famelab</a>, an international science communication competition similar to the increasingly popular "My thesis in 180s" contest.
    </p><p>
    In this performance, entitled <em>Future is coming</em>,  I discuss how artificial intelligence and machine learning are invading our everyday lives.
