  abstract = {The lack of security of the Internet routing protocol (BGP) has allowed attackers to divert Internet traffic and consequently perpetrate service disruptions, monetary frauds, and even citizen surveillance for decades. State-of-the-art defenses rely on geo-distributed BGP monitors to detect rogue BGP announcements. As we show, though, attackers can easily evade detection by engineering their announcements. This paper presents Oscilloscope, an approach to accurately detect BGP hijacks by relying on real-time traffic analysis. As hijacks inevitably change the characteristics of the diverted traffic, the key idea is to track these changes in real time and flag them. The main challenge is that "normal" Internet events (e.g., network reconfigurations, link failures, load balancing) also change the underlying traffic characteristics - and they are way more frequent than hijacks. Naive traffic analyses would hence lead to too many false positives. We observe that hijacks typically target a subset of the prefixes announced by Internet service providers and only divert a subset of their traffic. In contrast, normal events lead to more uniform changes across prefixes and traffic. Oscilloscope uses this observation to filter out non-hijack events by checking whether they affect multiple related prefixes or not. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Oscilloscope quickly and accurately detects hijacks in realistic traffic traces containing hundreds of events.},

  abstract = {Generalizing machine learning (ML) models for network traffic dynamics tends to be considered a lost cause. Hence, for every new task, we often resolve to design new models and train them on model-specific datasets collected, whenever possible, in an environment mimicking the model's deployment. This approach essentially gives up on generalization. Yet, an ML architecture called\_Transformer\_ has enabled previously unimaginable generalization in other domains. Nowadays, one can download a model pre-trained on massive datasets and only fine-tune it for a specific task and context with comparatively little time and data. These fine-tuned models are now state-of-the-art for many benchmarks. We believe this progress could translate to networking and propose a Network Traffic Transformer (NTT), a transformer adapted to learn network dynamics from packet traces. Our initial results are promising: NTT seems able to generalize to new prediction tasks and contexts. This study suggests there is still hope for generalization, though it calls for a lot of future research.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool to model the complexity of communication networks. As networks evolve, we cannot only train once and deploy. Retraining models, known as continual learning, is necessary. Yet, to date, there is no established methodology to answer the key questions: With which samples to retrain? When should we retrain?  We address these questions with the sample selection system Memento, which maintains a training set with the "most useful" samples to maximize sample space coverage. Memento particularly benefits rare patterns---the notoriously long "tail" in networking---and allows assessing rationally when retraining may help, i.e., when the coverage changes.  We deployed Memento on Puffer, the live-TV streaming project, and achieved a 14\% reduction of stall time, 3.5{\texttimes} the improvement of random sample selection. Memento is model-agnostic and can be applied beyond video streaming.},

Driven by safety and privacy concerns in network communications and online services, much theoretical work has been conducted in order to design opaque systems. A system is opaque if an external observer in unable to infer a secret about the system behavior. This paper aims to review the most commonly used techniques of opacity validation for deterministic models and opacity quantification for probabilistic ones. Available complexity results are also provided. Finally, we review existing tools for opacity validation and current applications.},

  abstract = {Wirelessly interconnected sensors, actuators, and controllers promise greater flexibility, lower installation and maintenance costs, and higher robustness in harsh conditions than wired solutions. However, to facilitate the adoption of wireless communication in cyber-physical systems (CPS), the functional and non-functional properties must be similar to those known from wired architectures. We thus present Time-Triggered Wireless (TTW), a wireless architecture for multi-mode CPS that offers reliable communication with guarantees on end-to-end delays among distributed applications executing on low-cost, low-power embedded devices. We achieve this by exploiting the high reliability and deterministic behavior of a synchronous transmission based communication stack we design, and by coupling the timings of distributed task executions and message exchanges across the wireless network by solving a novel co-scheduling problem. While some of the concepts in TTW have existed for some time and TTW has already been successfully applied for feedback control and coordination of multiple mechanical systems with closed-loop stability guarantees, this paper presents the key algorithmic, scheduling, and networking mechanisms behind TTW, along with their experimental evaluation, which have not been known so far. TTW is open source and ready to use: ttw.ethz.ch},

  abstract = {When designing their performance evaluations, networking researchers often encounter questions such as: How long should a run be? How many runs to perform? How to account for the variability across multiple runs? What statistical methods should be used to analyze the data? Despite their best intentions, researchers often answer these questions differently, thus impairing the replicability of their evaluations and the confidence in their results. In this paper, we propose a concrete methodology for the design and analysis of performance evaluations. Our approach hierarchically partitions the performance evaluation into three timescales, following the principle of separation of concerns. The idea is to understand, for each timescale, the temporal characteristics of variability sources, and then to apply rigorous statistical methods to derive performance results with quantifiable confidence in spite of the inherent variability. We implement this methodology in a software framework called TriScale. For each performance metric, TriScale computes a variability score that estimates, with a given confidence, how similar the results would be if the evaluation were replicated; in other words, TriScale quantifies the replicability of evaluations. We showcase the practicality and usefulness of TriScale on four different case studies demonstrating that TriScale helps to generalize and strengthen published results. Improving the standards of replicability in networking is a complex challenge. This paper is an important contribution to this endeavor; it provides networking researchers with a rational and concrete experimental methodology rooted in sound statistical foundations. The first of its kind.},

  abstract = {Today, the ICT industry has a massive carbon footprint (a few percent of the worldwide emissions) and one of the fastest growth rates. The Internet accounts for a large part of that footprint while being also energy inefficient; i.e., the total energy cost per byte transmitted is very high. Thankfully, there are many ways to improve on the current status; we discuss two relatively unexplored directions in this paper. Putting network devices to ``sleep,'' i.e., turning them off, is known to be an efficient vector to save energy; we argue that harvesting this potential requires new routing protocols, better suited to devices switching on/off often, and revising the corresponding hardware/software co-design. Moreover, we can reduce the embodied carbon footprint by using networking hardware longer, and we argue that this could even be beneficial for reliability! We sketch our first ideas in these directions and outline practical challenges that we (as a community) need to address to make the Internet more sustainable.},

While we are not (yet) able to turn on and off line cards in milliseconds, we can do so a couple of times per day. The question is, does it make sense to save energy? It may: We estimate we could potentially save in the order of MWh per year with link sleeping and down-rating in a cloud provider network. Importantly, these are ``easy'' gains: They would come without modifying the routing state nor impacting the quality of service of the traffic; it only leverages the typically low utilization of the links. This study provides only a rough approximation of the potential savings of rate adaptation and leaves several practical questions open. More than anything else, it motivates further investigation of the approach.},

Low-power wireless technology is preferred for its low cost, small form factor, and flexibility, especially if the devices support multi-hop communication. So far, however, feedback control over wireless multi-hop networks has only been shown for update intervals on the order of seconds. This paper presents a wireless embedded system that tames imperfections impairing control performance (e.g., jitter and message loss), and a control design that exploits the essential properties of this system to provably guarantee closed-loop stability for physical processes with linear time-invariant dynamics. Using experiments on a cyber-physical testbed with 20 wireless nodes and multiple cart-pole systems, we are the first to demonstrate and evaluate feedback control and coordination over wireless multi-hop networks for update intervals of 20 to 50 milliseconds.},
